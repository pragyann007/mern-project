erfect 👌 You’re basically building a full-stack SaaS product like “Salonist” or “Shedul” (used by beauty salons, spas, barbershops, etc.).
Let me break it down step by step:

🔹 Is this project useful?

✅ Yes, very useful. Small salons, barbershops, spas, beauty parlors, and even clinics need this type of solution. Right now, many use pen-paper or Excel, so an easy SaaS product is a huge upgrade.

🔹 Can you sell it?

Yes. A few price ideas:

Basic version (local shops, one-time sale): NPR 20,000 – 50,000 (USD $150–$400)

SaaS subscription (multi-salon, cloud hosted): NPR 1,500 – 3,000/month (USD $10–$25 per salon)

With branding, mobile app, analytics → can go up to NPR 1 lakh+ (USD $800+)
